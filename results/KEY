res_relfrq_final.mat - Is the effect of the relative frequency of the pattern being presented. Range of frequency is 0.5 : 0.5 : 5.0
res_mixvar_final.mat - Measure the effect of a mixed variance signal on performance. Mixed variance in range 0.0 : 0.5 : 5.0
res_numaff_final.mat - Measures the effect of the number of afferents on the performance of the network, range is 50: 50 : 1000
resultsdyn_final.mat - Effect of different starting fgi with dynamic error calculation. fgi range 0.0230 : 0.0001 : 0.0238
resultsfix_final.mat - As per resultsdyn_final.mat but for fixed error calculation. 
resultsdyn_final6.mat - As per resultsdyn_final.mat except for range 0.0226 : 0.0001 : 0.0229
resultsfix_final6.mat - As per resultsdyn_final6.mat but for fixed error. 

NOTE: Accuracy measure changed to only include the last seconds of simulation at this point.
    Poisson patterns were also fixed to be less periodic (calculated in possible slots rather than a number per second evenly spaced).
res_salfgi_final.mat - Explores the effects of simulated annealing when If is fixed to 0.0222 and fgi is varied from 0.0233 : 0.0001 : 0.0242, Tf is 30, accuracy evaluated on last 20 seconds only.
res_salIf_final.mat - Explores the effect of simulated annearling when fgi is fixed to 0.0238 and If varied from 0.0215 : 0.0001 : 0.0226, Tf is 30, accuracy evaluated on last 20 seconds only.
res_patxln_final.mat - Explores the effect of run time on performance. range is [30, 60, 90, 150, 240, 360, 450], Tf was set as sim_time_sec - 20, and last 20 seconds were test time, Performance is very poor, not sure why and didn't save enough to figure out.
res_ptxlen_final.mat - As above, but with no simulated annealing, Pf = 5; fgi = 0.0230; full logging now added.
res_pfgi5h_final.mat - Exploring the role of the FGI with a Pf of 5hz. range is 0.0230 : 0.0001 : 0.0238 Note this was before switching to balancedpoisson as a datasource

NOTE: Switched to balancedpoisson for datasource
res_5hnmaf_final.mat - This is the 5Hz Pf number of afferents trial range is 50 : 100 : 1000, sim_time_sec = 150, test_seconds = 50
res_5hfgi1_final.mat - This is the 5Hz Pf poifgi experiemnt, mainly for me to see how fgi influences performance, sim_time_sec = 50, test_seconds = 20;
res_5h150fgi1_final.mat - 5Hz version, 150seconds, 30 repeats, 50 test_seconds, range 0.0222 : 0.0004 : 0.0238 
res_5hfreq_final.mat - As above but for frequency - range 0.5 : 0.5 : 5.0
res_5hmixv_final.mat - As above but for mixed variance, range 0.0 : 0.5 : 5.0

NOTE: Accuracy was miscalcualted for the above, considered all spikes > testing_seconds not within testing seconds of the end.
res_5hdrop_final.mat - As above but for spike deletion, range 0 : 0.1 : 1 - Lots of missing data and issue with this run, not worth recovering
res_150drp_final.mat - var_range defined in res file
res_150frq_final.mat - var_range defined in res file
res_150naf_final.mat - var_range defined in res file
res_150fgi1_final.mat - var_range defined in res file
res_450fgi1_final.mat - var_range defined in res file, 450 second simulation, Last 50 seconds for testing.
res_150jit_final.mat - Probable error - pattfun was overwritten with [] menaing no jitter was added.
res_150jits_final.mat - A repeat of jitter split over 3 jobs, ranges 0 : 1 : 2, 3 : 1 : 5, 6 : 1 : 8 (for speed reasons) it would seem 150jit (no s) didn't have the jitter...
res_parfgi150_final.mat - made up of parfgi1504 and 7 both smaller ranges to be combined with 150fgi1 for a wider range.
res_parfgi450_final.mat - Made up of parfgi45057 and 80 being the ranges 0.0225-8 (added together with 450fgi1 for wider range).

NOTE: default fgi now shifted to 0.0226
res_26frq_final.mat - This and below are all repeats with the fgi set to 0.0226
res_26naf_final.mat - As above
res_26drp_final.mat - As above
res_26jit_final.mat - As above

res_28jit_final.mat - additional range for jit plot, eventually combined into bigjit.
res_30jit_final.mat - Continuation of exploring the jitter effect, last section of the range, eventually combined with 26jit, 28jit into bigjit
res_6frq_final.mat - Redoing the frequency plot in a new range 0.5 : 0.5 : 6.0 instead of the old 1 : 1 : 10
res_bigjit_final.mat - A post processed combination of 26jit 28jit and 30jit, now covers range 2 : 2 : 44 ms

NOTE: Just did the off by 1 balancedpoisson noise fix (likely cause of >35% random chance error). drp and naf (and all) will likely need to be repeated.
