res_poifgi_final.mat - Is the effect of fgi on performance in the new model. Range is 0.0230 : 0.0001 : 0.0238.
res_patdrp_final.mat - Is the effect of removing a percentage of neurons from each pattern presentation. What spikes are removed is randomly chosen for each presentation. Range is 0 : 0.1 : 100, being the percentaged dropped from each presentation
res_relfrq_final.mat - Is the effect of the relative frequency of the pattern being presented. Range of frequency is 0.5 : 0.5 : 5.0
res_mixvar_final.mat - Measure the effect of a mixed variance signal on performance. Mixed variance in range 0.0 : 0.5 : 5.0
res_numaff_final.mat - Measures the effect of the number of afferents on the performance of the network, range is 50: 50 : 1000
resultsdyn_final.mat - Effect of different starting fgi with dynamic error calculation. fgi range 0.0230 : 0.0001 : 0.0238
resultsfix_final.mat - As per resultsdyn_final.mat but for fixed error calculation. 
resultsdyn_final6.mat - As per resultsdyn_final.mat except for range 0.0226 : 0.0001 : 0.0229
resultsfix_final6.mat - As per resultsdyn_final6.mat but for fixed error. 

NOTE: Accuracy measure changed to only include the last seconds of simulation at this point.
    Poisson patterns were also fixed to be less periodic (calculated in possible slots rather than a number per second evenly spaced).
res_salfgi_final.mat - Explores the effects of simulated annealing when If is fixed to 0.0222 and fgi is varied from 0.0233 : 0.0001 : 0.0242, Tf is 30, accuracy evaluated on last 20 seconds only.
res_salIf_final.mat - Explores the effect of simulated annearling when fgi is fixed to 0.0238 and If varied from 0.0215 : 0.0001 : 0.0226, Tf is 30, accuracy evaluated on last 20 seconds only.
res_patxln_final.mat - Explores the effect of run time on performance. range is [30, 60, 90, 150, 240, 360, 450], Tf was set as sim_time_sec - 20, and last 20 seconds were test time, Performance is very poor, not sure why and didn't save enough to figure out.
res_ptxlen_final.mat - As above, but with no simulated annealing, Pf = 5; fgi = 0.0230; full logging now added.
res_pfgi5h_final.mat - Exploring the role of the FGI with a Pf of 5hz. range is ..... Note this was before switching to balancedpoisson as a datasource

NOTE: Switched to balancedpoisson for datasource
res_5hnmaf_final.mat - This is the 5Hz Pf number of afferents trial range is 50 : 100 : 1000, sim_time_sec = 150, test_seconds = 50
res_5hfgi1_final.mat - This is the 5Hz Pf poifgi experiemnt, mainly for me to see how fgi influences performance, sim_time_sec = 50, test_seconds = 20;
res_5h150fgi1_final.mat - 5Hz version, 150seconds, 30 repeats, 50 test_seconds, range 0.0222 : 0.0004 : 0.0238 
res_5hfreq_final.mat - As above but for frequency - range 0.5 : 0.5 : 5.0
res_5hmixv_final.mat - As above but for mixed variance, range 0.0 : 0.5 : 5.0
res_5hpdrp_final.mat - As above but for spike deletion, range 0 : 20 : 100
